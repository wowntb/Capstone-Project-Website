# Capstone-Project-IV-Website
This website was built as part of my project for a HyperionDev coding course. The website is based on my passion for anime, and I had to 
use my accumulated knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to complete this task. It had to be functional and well designed.

## The process
I wrote all the HTML, CSS, and JS code in VS Code and uploaded the files to this remote repository.

## Using/installing
You can download this repository as a zip if you'd like.
The site is currently being hosted on GitHub pages. You can visit it at https://wowntb.github.io/Capstone-Project-IV-Website/

## Credits
I, Nathenale, am the sole contributor of this project. All coding was done by me.
